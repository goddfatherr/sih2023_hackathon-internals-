# Smart India Hackathon: School Elimination Rounds

Welcome to the documentation of the solution implemented by our team for the Smart India Hackathon, School Elimination Rounds. Our solution addresses the following problem statement:

**Problem Statement:** A Health Monitoring System for Street Light Nodes
**Problem Statement Link:** [Solution Description](https://sih.gov.in/sih2023)

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main folders, each representing a crucial aspect of our solution:

### 1. Decentralized Monitoring

The `decentralized_monitoring` folder provides a simulation environment for street light nodes. This component simulates the behavior of street light nodes, allowing to test and monitor how the system will work distributed and deployed at scale. 

### 2. SL Sensor Nodes

The `sl_sensor_nodes` folder hosts the actual prototype implementation based on the ESP32 microcontroller.
